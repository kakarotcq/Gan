The code wgan-gp_cifar10.py refers to https://github.com/caogang/wgan-gp.  
The result image is samples_99999.jpg indicating 100000 epoches  
The code in test is to test the descriminator trianed by wgan_gp. I saparately feed the discriminator with 10000 images generated by Gnet and 10000 real  
images. I got the result 0.76% correct rate with fake images and 94% with real images.
